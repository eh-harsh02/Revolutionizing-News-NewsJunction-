            Centre officially implements Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019,
            notifies rules
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Central government has officially notified the rules of the
            Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), following Union Home
            Minister Amit Shah's announcement of its implementation before the
            Lok Sabha elections. This law facilitates Indian citizenship for
            non-Muslim migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan who
            arrived before December 31, 2014. The CAA targets minorities
            including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains, and Parsis
            facing persecution in Muslim-majority countries. The 2019 amendment
            expedites citizenship for migrants facing religious persecution and
            reduces the residency requirement from twelve to six years. An
            Intelligence Bureau report estimates over 30,000 immediate
            beneficiaries once the rules are enacted. The CAA, passed by
            Parliament on December 11, 2019, was officially notified on December
            12 of the same year after over four years of amendment. The Home
            Ministry reported granting Indian citizenship to 1,414 non-Muslim
            minority migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan from
            April 1 to December 31, 2021.

            Apple loses top phonemaker spot to Samsung as iPhone shipments drop,
            IDC says
          </h3>
          <p>
            Global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% to 289.4 million units
            during January-March, with Samsung (005930.KS), opens new tab, at
            20.8% market share, clinching the top phonemaker spot from Apple.
            The iPhone-maker's steep sales decline comes after its strong
            performance in the December quarter when it overtook Samsung as the
            world's No.1 phone maker. It's back to the second spot, with 17.3%
            market share, as Chinese brands such as Huawei gain market share.
            Xiaomi, one of China's top smartphone makers, occupied the third
            position with a market share of 14.1% during the first quarter.
            South Korea's Samsung, which launched its latest flagship smartphone
            lineup - Galaxy S24 series - in the beginning of the year, shipped
            more than 60 million phones during the period. Global sales of
            Galaxy S24 smartphones jumped 8%, compared to last year's Galaxy S23
            series during their first three weeks of availability, data provider
            Counterpoint previously said. In the first quarter, Apple shipped
            50.1 million iPhones, down from 55.4 million units it shipped same
            period last year, according to IDC. Apple's smartphone shipments in
            China shrank 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023 from a year earlier.

            Firing outside Salman Khan's home: 'Gurugram-based gangster Vishal
            Rahul aka Kalu carried out the attack', say reports
          </h3>
          <p>
            Major update in the firing incident outside Salman Khan's Mumbai
            residence. According to reports, one of the shooters has been
            identified. Vishal Rahul is a wanted gangster from Gurugram and is
            known to be associated with Rohit Godara, who is linked to the
            Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Bishnoi is currently in Tihar Jail for his
            involvement in several high-profile murder cases including that of
            musician Sidhu Moose Wala and Rajput leader and Karni Sena chief
            Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi. This revelation has heightened fears and
            raised questions about the extent of organised crime networks
            operating in the region. Reports reveal that Vishal, also known as
            Kalu, has been implicated in several heinous crimes, including
            multiple killings and robberies in Haryana. Recently, he was
            allegedly involved in the murder of a bookie in Rohtak, purportedly
            on the instructions of Lawrence Bishnoi. Furthermore, a chilling
            Facebook post attributed to Anmol Bishnoi, Lawrence Bishnoi's
            younger brother, has surfaced, claiming responsibility for the
            shooting and issuing a warning to Salman Khan.

            The year 2024 is a big one for elections- given the sheer number of
            polls happening across the world. "Globally, more voters than ever

            results of which, for many, will prove consequential for years to
            come," the Time magazine said in an article in December last year.
            Well, a few of those elections are done already - Bangladesh,
            Pakistan, Taiwan and Russia, to name a few. And some have thrown up

            "Everyone Will Regret": PM Modi On Scrapping Of Electoral Bonds
            Scheme
          </h3>
          <p>
            <b>New Delhi:</b> The scrapping of the electoral bonds - in a
            landmark decision by the Supreme Court in February - is a decision
            "everyone will regret when there is honest reflection" and has
            "completely pushed the country towards black money", Prime Minister
            Narendra Modi told news agency ANI Monday. The Prime Minister said
            the electoral bonds scheme launched by his government was meant to
            fight the use of 'black money', referring to unaccounted cash or
            funds from criminal activities, in election campaigns, and that he
            had "never claimed this was an absolute way" to achieve that goal.
            Mr Modi also attacked the opposition for spreading "lies" about the
            bonds and said his government had introduced the scheme to cut down
            on 'black money' during elections. He countered criticism - that his
            Bharatiya Janata Party was the largest beneficiary, to the tune of
            thousands of crores.

          <h3>Tesla to layoff more than 10% of its staff</h3>
          <p>
            Tesla will lay off more than 10% of its workforce, tech publication
            Electrek reported on Monday, citing an internal memo, as the top
            auto-maker struggles with soft demand for its electric vehicles in a
            highly competitive market. Over the last few months, Tesla asked
            managers to identify critical team members, paused some stock
            rewards and canceled some employees’ annual reviews, according to
            the report. The world’s largest automaker by market value had
            140,473 employees globally as of December 2023, according to its
            latest annual report. The reported cuts will affect about 15,000
            workers. Tesla had previously laid off 4% of its workforce in New
            York in February last year as part of a performance review cycle and
            before a union campaign was to be launched by its employees.

              In 2022, it was announced that director Vetrimaaran and actor

              announcement was welcomed by Suriya fans as it marks the star’s

              of the film was released which featured an ancient coin with a
              bull. A promo of Suriya training for jallikattu (a traditional
              bull-taming game in Tamil Nadu) went viral. However, after such
              initial teasers, the film failed to progress, much to the
              disappointment of fans, who were further discouraged by rumours
              that the film is shelved. Now, Vetrimaaran has put an end to all
              such speculations and has confirmed that Vaadivasal is very much
              on the cards.

            Kumar-Tiger Shroff’s film trails behind OMG 2, fails to cross Rs 50

          </h3>
          <p>
            Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff’s latest film, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan,
            continues to maintain its stride at the box office after
            encountering a sharp decline on its second day of release. As per
            industry tracker Sacnilk, the movie amassed Rs 9 crore on Sunday,
            bringing its total domestic earnings to Rs 40.75 crore. Made at a
            reported budget of Rs 350 crore, the film’s makers had also
            introduced a buy-one-get-one offer on Sunday. Bade Miyan Chote
            Miyan’s worldwide collection stands at Rs 95.18 crore. The film made
            its debut at the box office on Thursday, coinciding with Eid
            festivities, and garnered Rs 15.65 crore in its opening. However, it
            experienced a setback in box office figures on the subsequent day,
            witnessing a 51 percent drop and earning Rs 7.6 crore on Friday.
            Despite a slight weekend surge, the collection remained in the
            single-digit range, with Rs 8.5 crore on Friday and Rs 9 crore on
            Sunday. For both Akshay and Tiger, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan holds
            significance as they strive to shake off the streak of unsuccessful
            films. Following a series of flops like Samrat Prithviraj, Raksha
            Bandhan and Cuttputlli, Akshay found success with OMG 2. However,
            Bade Miyan Chote Miyan has yet to surpass or match the box office
            performance of OMG 2, which amassed Rs 55.17 crore within the same
            timeframe.
